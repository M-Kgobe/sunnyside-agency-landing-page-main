### Challenges

I encountered a challenge when I tried to add something extra in my JS.

I basically tried to modify the navigation menu such that when you click outside of it, it automatically closes, on a half screen desktop site, it works just fine, But then i took it a step further to devtools, thats when the menu button did not work any more.

this is the code I added in the 
```js 
navActive()
``` 
of my navigation bar

```js
document.onclick = function (e) {
    if (e.target.id !== 'nav-links' && e.target.id !== 'hamburger') {
        navLinks.classList.remove("nav-active");
        hamburger.classList.remove("close");
    }
}
```
